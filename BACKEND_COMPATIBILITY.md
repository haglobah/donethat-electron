# Backend Compatibility

This repository contains the open-source desktop client for DoneThat. Hosted backend services remain proprietary.

## Open vs Closed Boundary

The desktop client code in this repository is public. The following remain closed and are not implemented here:

- hosted APIs and Cloud Functions
- the `app.donethat.ai` web app loaded inside the desktop client
- backend-side data storage, processing, billing, and access control

The desktop client expects those remote services to remain compatible with the payload categories documented below.

## Remote Services Used By The Client

- `https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com`
  - Firebase Authentication sign-in and token flows used by the renderer.
- `https://securetoken.googleapis.com`
  - Firebase token refresh flows used by the renderer.
- `https://firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com`
  - Firebase client installation management used by the Firebase SDK.
- `https://europe-west1-donethat.cloudfunctions.net/inputConfig`
  - Returns backend-managed local-processing configuration.
- `https://europe-west1-donethat.cloudfunctions.net/inputProcess`
  - Accepts locally processed capture results for downstream backend handling.
- `https://europe-west1-donethat.cloudfunctions.net/captureScreenshot`
  - Accepts capture-cycle uploads when the cloud processing path is used.
- `https://europe-west1-donethat.cloudfunctions.net/contextCapture`
  - Accepts optional focused context screenshots for configured apps.
- `https://app.donethat.ai`
  - Embedded portal/dashboard webview and related account flows.
- `https://checkout.stripe.com`
  - Hosted billing flow opened from the embedded portal.

## Remote Payload Categories

All DoneThat-managed API requests use Firebase ID token authentication unless noted otherwise.

### Firebase Auth And Token Services

- Email/password or federated sign-in data handled by Firebase Auth
- token refresh and client-installation metadata handled by Firebase SDK services

### `inputConfig`

Request categories:

- authenticated GET request with no capture payload

Response categories:

- local-processing configuration
- model/input limits and related backend-managed settings

### `inputProcess`

Request categories:

- capture timestamp
- structured local-processing output derived from screenshots, activity, and optional audio
- processing parameters used to produce that structured output
- optional client diagnostic metadata when enabled in the app

This endpoint is used after local image/audio processing. Local processing does not make the workflow fully offline; processed results are still sent to DoneThat services.

### `captureScreenshot`

Request categories:

- capture timestamp
- current screenshots
- previous screenshot context
- activity summaries derived from active-window tracking and idle detection
- optional audio capture payload for the cycle
- optional client diagnostic metadata when enabled in the app

This is the default cloud-backed capture path when local processing is not available.

### `contextCapture`

Request categories:

- capture timestamp
- focused screenshots for configured apps/windows
- app names and window titles associated with those focused screenshots

This path is optional and only used when context capture is enabled in the app.

### `app.donethat.ai`

The desktop app embeds the DoneThat web application for dashboard/account flows. Data handled there is governed by the web application and backend services, not by this repository alone.

Typical categories include:

- authenticated account/session state
- subscription and billing UI flows
- summary and dashboard data returned by DoneThat services

## Local Development Expectations

You can work on several parts of the desktop client without proprietary backend access:

- install dependencies
- run tests
- run `npm run build:prepare`
- work on renderer UI, settings, and main/renderer IPC flows
- work on packaging scripts and most desktop-only behavior

You cannot fully exercise these flows without compatible backend access:

- real sign-in against production-compatible Firebase/Auth configuration
- embedded portal behavior from `app.donethat.ai`
- cloud capture submission and backend summaries
- backend-managed local-processing config from `inputConfig`
- submission of locally processed results to `inputProcess`

## Trust Summary

The desktop client can collect sensitive workstation data depending on user settings.

- Screenshots: may include on-screen work content across one or more displays.
- Activity tracking: may include app names, window titles, durations, and idle-time summaries.
- Microphone capture: may include spoken audio recorded from the microphone when enabled.
- System audio capture: may include playback audio when enabled and supported by the operating system.

Users should assume those categories may be transmitted to DoneThat services when the related features are enabled and a compatible backend is available.
