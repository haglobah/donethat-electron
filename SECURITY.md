# Security

This covers vulnerabilities in the desktop client source code in this repository.

We use Aikido to monitor dependency and repository security issues as part of ongoing maintenance.

Firebase web API keys in `firebase-config.js` are public client identifiers, not secrets. Protect Firebase/GCP access with API key restrictions, Firebase Auth, Firestore/Storage rules, callable-function auth checks, and regular console-side rule reviews rather than by hiding the web key in the desktop bundle.

Please report security vulnerabilities privately to [support@donethat.ai](mailto:support@donethat.ai).

Include:
- impact summary
- reproduction steps
- affected app version
- affected OS/version

Please do not open public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.

Best effort: initial response within 5 business days.
